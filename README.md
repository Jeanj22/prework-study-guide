#  Prework Study Guide Webpage

## The Prework Study Guide project is a web application accessed via a web browser, that allows users to perform tasks on the internet. 

My motivation was to create a guide that provides information on some of the most fundamental programming languages.

I built this project to learn how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to create a web application.

This study guide will detail concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and help the user to learn how to use them correctly to code a web application.

Building this project taught me basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript; and how to use sync the local version of my code with the remote version in GitHub.

## Usage
The Prework Study Guide contains detailed notes on four topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

To see JavaScript, navigate to the DevTools console (this can be accessed by selecting ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù file in the browser, right-click and select "Inspect" from the menu). The console will list the topics we learned from Prework Study Guide and choose one topic for us to study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
